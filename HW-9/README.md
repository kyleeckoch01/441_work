This week had a lot of information, but I feel like I have a pretty good understanding of how everything ties together.  With that said, I am having issues getting my information to actually show anything on my page, but based off comparing my code to the example code, I believe all of the information is there.  I think there might just be a certain spot that something got messed up which is messing with the entire code.  I also struggled a bit with creating my own plugin, but I gave it a try and hopefully once I get my page up and running my plugin will successfully work.
