For the homework this week, I found it to be fairly easy. It was helpful to have a light homework week so that I could go back and review information from previous courses to make sure that my web design skills are up to par. I have used JavaScript in the past, but was never really aware of what it was and the importance behind it, so I am happy that we went more in depth this week about what exactly its purpose is.  I also found it to be very useful to figure out how to access the web console.  While finishing my script.js I checked the web console a lot to make sure that I was doing the work correctly.  I am excited to explore JavaScript more and see what else I can add to my websites using it.
