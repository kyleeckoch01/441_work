This week's assignment has been extremely difficult for me.  I worked out everything on my index.html so that my story was being told, and also there is a display of buttons to make choices.  Doing this, though, did not set me up for an easy set up of the main.js.  I am completely lost on how to get it to all connect together and link it so that the buttons flow together with the options when clicked.  I think that I am going to go back and revisit my index.html and maybe not include the buttons in the way that I have them now, but rather make my site have pop ups and have answers be entered there, and the player can proceed through the game that way.  I apologize for not having an exciting site to show, the CSS is lacking as that was the least of my worries this week, I was mainly focused on the JavaScript.  I was very frustrated that my work on my index.html made it difficult for me to even attempt my main.js, but I plan on working through my issues further and possibly coming in for office hours so that I can get it figured out.  I would have turned it in late and completed, but I figure that I attempted it and I want to show that, and I will work on it and improve it now so that I can stay caught up with our course information.
