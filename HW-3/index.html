    <h1>What Will You Choose?</h1>
    <br></br>
    <p>Today you will be faced with choices that determine how you spend your day.</p>
    <p>How good of a day you have will all depend on your decisions throughout the game.</p>
    <p>Good Luck!</p>

    </div>

    <!--Decision 1 for the morning-->
    <div class="decisions" id="decision1">
      <p>It's 6:30 in the morning and you are awakened by a dog barking next door.</p>
      <p>You have one of two choices to make: Do you fall back asleep and sleep in for the day?</p>
      <p>Or do you get up despite being exhausted and get an early jump on the day?</p>
      <button id="Sleep" onclick="myChoice()">Sleep In</button> <button id="Wake Up" onclick="myChoice()">Wake Up</button>
      <br></br>
    </div>

    <!--Decision 2 sleep-->
    <div class="decisions" id="decision2Sleep">
      <p>You decided to say no thank you to an early morning and sleep in until 11:00 AM.
      You have not gotten that good of a sleep in a long, long time and you are feeling refreshed and ready to go.
      You check your phone and realize that you have a missed call from your friend.  He left a voicemail saying that
      he has an extra ticket to a concert tonight and wants you to come with.  You call him back and it turns out that you are
      too late. He has already found someone else to go with.  Do you buy your own ticket for the concert, or do you decide that
      maybe it is a sign it wasn't meant to be?
      </p>
      <button id="Buy" onclick="myChoice()">Buy a Ticket</button> <button id="Sign" onclick="myChoice()">Not Meant to be</button>
      <br></br>
      </div>

    <!--Decision 2 wake up-->
    <div class="decisions" id="decision2Wake">
      <p>Waking up early turned out to be a great decision.  You made yourself a delicious cup of coffee, got some work done, and got some great news!
        Your friend called you and has an extra ticket to see one of your favorite bands in concert!  Score!  You agree to going with him, but you
        have a decision to make.  Should you wear your black or red band tee to the concert?
      </p>
      <button id="Black" onclick="myChoice()">Black</button> <button id="Red" onclick="myChoice()">Red</button>
      <br></br>
      </div

    <!--Decision 3 buy a ticket-->
    <div class="decisions" id="decision2Buy">
      <p>You decided that you just cannot miss out on this concert, so you go to the website and buy your own ticket.
        You call your friend to tell him and he is thrilled! Now you have to decide if you want to go and buy a new for the concert
        or if you want to save that money and get some drinks with your friend before the concert?
        </p>
        <button id="Outfit" onclick="myChoice()">New Outfit</button> <button id="Drinks" onclick="myChoice()">Drinks</button>
        <br></br>
        </div

      <!--Decision 3 sign-->
      <div class="decisions" id="decision2Not">
        <p>You decided that it's a sign that you missed your friends call and it might be better to just stay home.
          That's okay, though, you have plenty of stuff to get done around the house.  Instead of buying a ticket to the concert
          you decide to buy a lottery ticket from the gas station.  DING DING DING...WINNER!  What will you buy with your new fortune?
          </p>
          <button id="Island" onclick="myChoice()">Buy an Island</button> <button id="Jet" onclick="myChoice()">Private Jet</button>
          <br></br>
      </div>

      <!--Decision 3 Black-->
      <div class="decisions" id="decision2Black">
        <p>You decided to go with the black band tee. It fits you better and is brand new.
          Now you have to decide if you will go buy a new pair of jeans to match, or find something
          that could work in your closet?
          </p>
          <button id="New" onclick="myChoice()">Go Shopping</button> <button id="find" onclick="myChoice()">Find Something from Closet</button>
          <br></br>
      </div>

      <!--Decision 3 Red-->
      <div class="decisions" id="decision2Red">
        <p>You chose the red shirt, while it may be old, it is a classic and you are going to look rockin' in it.
          The only problem is that you cannot find it anywhere.  You call your sister and she has it at her house.
          Do you drive across town to go and get it, or do you just settle for the black tee?
          </p>
        <button id="Drive" onclick="myChoice()">Drive to get it</button> <button id="Settle" onclick="myChoice()">Settle for the Black</button>
