This week was a struggle for me.  I feel like I need to go back through all of the course material and try to get a better understanding of it.  I plan to continue to work through my issues and get them resolved before next week.  At one point I was able to get my images to appear as the little icon, but after playing around with the code I went wrong somewhere and have now lost that.  I also at one point was able to get my squares to move, and after trying to reposition and move those I am not able to get them to move anymore either.  Text is not transitioning, images aren't fading.  Quite the mess if I do say so myself.  Definitely not my best work but I am hoping to work through the issues and hopefully turn in a much better version within the next couple of days.
