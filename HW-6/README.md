This week actually went very smoothly for me.  I think that it really helped splitting the game into two separate weeks, because it gave me time to figure out what went wrong last week and perfect it for this week.  Overall, I am happy with how my game turned out.  The CSS portion, not so much, but I figure that the most important part is the script, so the CSS is something I will come back and revisit.  I am hoping to get the cards aligned in two rows horizontally so that it would be easier for the player to see all of their choices.  Other than that, though, this week was a good one for me!
