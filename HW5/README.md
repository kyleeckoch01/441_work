I found this week to be very interesting.  I struggled quite a bit at first to figure out how to get my cards to display and show my blanks.  I did eventually figure that out, but I am struggling to get all of my placeholder images to display.  I could only figure out how to get my placeholder1.jpg and placeholder2.jpeg to display in my game, but not my other three placeholders.  This is something that I am going to have to go back and mess around with to see if I can fix this issue.  My CSS is once again extremely simple, but still matches the aesthetics of the cards that are flipped, so it is a nice compliment as a background.  Overall, I think that the week went pretty well, but I definitely need to go back and revisit my main.js and continue to play around with my code to try and get all of my images to only display twice.
