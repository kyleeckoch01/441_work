This week's assignment came a lot easier to me, as it felt like we were kind of putting everything that we have learned thus far together into one.  As of right now, I am having a difficult time getting my objects to appear in any of the browsers that I have tried to use.  I am not super sure as to why this is.  When I open it in chrome and firefox I get the same issues in my web console, but then when I open it in internet explorer I do not get any errors in my console log.  Because of this, I am only able to see my canvas outline and none of the squares that I called, but I am hoping even though I cannot see it on my end hopefully it can be seen by other people.  I am going to continue to work on it and see if I can get anything to show up in my browsers.
