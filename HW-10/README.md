For homework 10 I had a lot of struggles figuring out to complete the assignment.  It is still not completely finished, but I got the basics down for it which is better than having nothing turned in.  I plan to continue to explore how to achieve the things I was not able to, so that I can apply it to the homework for assignment 11.  I basically just need to figure out collisions, and changing the color of the background/squares.  Once I figure those out I plan to revisit this assignment and make those changes.
