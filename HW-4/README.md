I found this week to be easier than last, but I still found myself getting frustrated because I could not get certain things to work.  As far as input boxes goes, I have all of the boxes that I wanted for this project.  I could not figure out to get the site to restart at the end, but it is something I am going to continue to play with.  I updated my style by adding a different background color and an image.  I also changed the fonts.  One thing I struggled with in CSS was how to modify the input boxes and the buttons.  I finally got them all to align in the center, but I was hoping to figure out how to change the font and color of both of them, but that was also something I could not figure out.  I do intend on continuing to play around with this, as right now the inputs and buttons look out of place and do not go with the theme of the site.  Overall this week was not too bad.  It was a little bit tedious (as I feel coding often is), but it was good practice and I look forward to playing around with this stuff more because I plan on implementing it into my final for the course.
