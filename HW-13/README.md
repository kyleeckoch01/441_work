This week's homework was a nice refreshment from the past couple of weeks.  I was actually able to accomplish what was needed with quite some ease.  I struggled a bit with getting my model to show up, but after messing around with it for awhile I got it figured out.  As far as getting my objects to move with the mouse, I had to do some research, but ended up finding an example code that explained it pretty well.  I am definitely thankful to be done, and glad that this week was an easy week for homework.
