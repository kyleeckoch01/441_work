This week was honestly extremely frustrating for me.  I was able to successfully add more platforms into the game, but other than that I struggled to add different sprites.  It was also very unhelpful that my live server was not working properly so half of the time I was not even sure if my changes were working or not.  This week is definitely not my best work, but I found myself getting very frustrated so I chose to take a step back from the assignment and submit what I have thus far to show that I have been working on it, and I plan to come back to it tomorrow and revisit it and make the changes and improvements to get my game properly functioning.
