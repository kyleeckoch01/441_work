This weeks homework was a bit of a challenge for me due to the fact that I have not practiced my web design skills in about six months.  I forgot a lot of the basics, so I had to go back and look through a lot of my old codes in order to refresh my memory.  My site is definitely not fancy, it is basic and shows the simple skills that I know how to do.  I did not want to get too in depth for my first project back in coding mainly just so that I could get back into the hang of it.  I relied heavily on my css to make my site aesthetically pleasing, and kept my html very simple and organized so that I did not get confused or have a messy code to work with.  Overall, after this week I feel comfortable again with coding and I am ready to expand my skills in order to create more visually pleasing websites.
