I struggled a bit with this week's content.  I still am not able to get the images information to show (title, author, description, year), so I am going to continue working with that to try and figure it out.  I originally was struggling to get my button to link and make my images show up randomly, but after doing some research online I figured that out, so I am happy about that.  CSS is not great, pretty basic per usual, but there is enough to make it somewhat enjoyable to look at.
